# Clone the project

To first get our source code, you need to **fork** the project.

1. Go to our [github project](https://github.com/TreyWW/MyFinances/fork) and press "FORK"
> ![fork-project](fork-project)
2. Copy the fork URL that you have just created for later, it should look like `https://github.com/YourUsername/MyFinances.git`
3. Go into the source directory on **your computer** where you would like the local source code to go, e.g. `E:/projects/`
4. Open the terminal (if on windows type `cmd` into the search bar) and press enter
    > ![type-cmd](type-cmd)
5. Run the command:
    ```Bash
        git clone [fork URL from step 2]
       
       # For example this may look like:
       # git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MyFinances.git  
    ```

Well done, you have now got the MyFinances source code on your local machine!
