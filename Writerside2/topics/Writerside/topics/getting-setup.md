# Getting started

Welcome to MyFinances, this guide will help you get setup and running this application for yourself!

Here's a brief logical set of steps to get setup:

<snippet id="setup-structure">

1. Clone the project
2. Setup some environment variables
3. Setup Django (our backend)
4. Setup a database
4. Setup Tailwind (our frontend css library)
5. Run the project!

</snippet>

> If you plan to run this project in production, we highly support some AWS Services to help you along this process,
as they provide very good managed services. You may use other services, but we may not have full support.

There are two versions of our guides, one for Jetbrains products, and one for any other IDE. Jetbrains PyCharm Professional
gives great support for Django, so we do encourage it - though it's not required to work on our project or run it.
